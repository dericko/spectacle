# Spectacle

Spec-driven, agent-orchestrated video generation pipeline. Drop in a content spec, get an MP4 — with content-addressed caching at every stage, two human-in-the-loop review windows, and an independent math verification gate before any frames are rendered.

## How it works

A run starts with a **content spec** — a small JSON object describing what you want to teach (or pitch, or explain). The spec flows through a LangGraph graph whose nodes produce content-addressed artifacts. Each artifact is hashed from its inputs; re-running the same spec skips every stage whose inputs haven't changed.

**Pipeline stages:**

```
Spec → Structure → Script Agent → [Interrupt A] → Scene Planner → [Interrupt B] → Verify Gate → Render (fan-out) → Mux → MP4
```

- **Structure** — the domain pack turns the spec into an ordered list of scene stubs with render hints
- **Script Agent** — an LLM writes narration and on-screen text for each scene; for verified scenes it also writes a stated answer (e.g. `"7/8"`)
- **Interrupt A** — pauses for human review of the script; the human can approve, edit via chat, or paste raw JSON
- **Scene Planner** — assigns a concrete renderer (`remotion` or `manim`) to each scene based on its render hint
- **Interrupt B** — pauses for human review of the scene graph; renderer tags can be overridden here
- **Verification Gate** — runs domain-supplied checks (e.g. sympy math equivalence) on every flagged scene; a failed check stops the run before rendering
- **Render (fan-out)** — each scene renders independently and in parallel; cached scenes are skipped
- **Mux** — FFmpeg concatenates scene clips to produce the final MP4

**Run modes** control whether interrupts fire:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `accept_edits` (default) | Pauses at Interrupt A and B for human review |
| `auto` | Skips both interrupts; verification gate still always runs |

---

## Architecture

The repo has three layers that depend only downward.

### packages/core — the engine

`spectacle-core` owns the LangGraph graph, artifact store, TTS, renderer routing, and all pipeline nodes. It **never imports from `domains/`**. The only domain-facing surface is the `DomainPack` protocol — four attributes described in [Creating a domain pack](#creating-a-domain-pack).

### Content-addressed artifacts

Every pipeline stage produces a pydantic model that embeds its upstream hash and a `node_version` string. The hash is SHA-256 of canonical JSON (sorted keys, no whitespace). Before running any node, the graph checks whether an artifact with that hash already exists in the store — if it does, the node is skipped.

Per-scene hashing uses only that scene's own fields: narration text, on-screen text, renderer tag, render params, expression, and stated answer. Editing one scene's text invalidates only that scene's render — siblings are reused untouched.

### Human interrupts and kill/resume

LangGraph's `interrupt()` primitive pauses the graph and persists its full state in Postgres. The graph can be killed at any point and resumed later — even after restarting the server — because the checkpointer reconstructs state from the database, not from in-process memory.

Resuming carries an editable artifact back into the graph via `Command(resume={action: "approve"|"edit", artifact: {...}})`. The full artifact payload flows through so downstream nodes always see the human's final version.

### Renderer routing

Scene stubs carry a `render_hint`:

| Hint | Renderer | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `"layout"` | Remotion | Text, typography, layout scenes |
| `"equation_morph"` | Manim | Animated equation rendering |

The scene planner translates hints to concrete renderer tags. The human can override any tag at Interrupt B.

### domains/education — the first domain pack

The education pack knows about fractions, algebra, and pedagogy. It:

- Validates `EducationSpec` (learning objective, worked-example expression, target duration, audience)
- Runs `budget_scenes()` to deterministically pick a scene sequence — intro → concept explanation(s) → worked example → guided practice → recap — that fits the requested duration
- Fills expressions into worked-example and guided-practice stubs via LLM calls
- Runs `sympy_equivalence_gate` to verify the script's stated answer against the expression; catches LLM math errors before any frames are rendered

### apps/ — the runnable app

Three pieces:

- **FastAPI server** (`apps/server/`) — `POST /runs`, `GET /runs/:id`, `GET /runs/:id/artifacts`, interrupt chat/resume, simulate-crash, resume endpoints
- **Next.js frontend** (`apps/web/`) — Start Run page, live artifact tree view (polling every 2s), chat+JSON review panel, crash/resume controls
- **Remotion renderer** (`apps/renderer-remotion/`) — React compositions for layout scenes

---

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Node.js 18+, npm
- Docker (for Postgres), or a local Postgres 14+ instance
- FFmpeg on `$PATH`
- macOS `say` command (for TTS) — or implement `TTSProvider` for another platform
- Manim — see [install guide](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html); install into the project venv with `uv pip install manim` after step 1

### 1. Clone and install Python packages

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dericko/spectacle
cd spectacle
uv sync
```

This creates a root `.venv/`, installs all three local packages in editable mode (`spectacle-core`, `spectacle-education`, `spectacle-server`), and adds `pytest`. No manual venv activation needed — prefix commands with `uv run`.

### 2. Start Postgres

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Starts Postgres on port 5432 with credentials `spectacle / spectacle / spectacle`. To use an existing instance, set `SPECTACLE_PG_CONN` before running the server.

Every API route requires a shared bearer token: set `SPECTACLE_API_KEY` (server) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SPECTACLE_API_KEY` (web app, same value) before running the stack. CORS alone does not stop direct HTTP clients from reaching the API, so the server refuses to start serving requests (500s) until this is configured.

### 3. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
cd apps/web && npm install && cd -
cd apps/renderer-remotion && npm install && cd -
```

### 4. Wire up your LLM client

Three functions are left as `NotImplementedError` stubs and need a real LLM before the pipeline can run end-to-end:

| File | Function | Called with |
|---|---|---|
| `domains/education/src/spectacle_education/structure_agent.py` | `default_content_hint_llm` | `(spec: EducationSpec, stub: SceneStub) → str` |
| `domains/education/src/spectacle_education/structure_agent.py` | `default_guided_practice_expression_llm` | `(spec: EducationSpec) → str` |
| `packages/core/src/spectacle_core/nodes/script_agent.py` | `default_script_llm` | `(stub: SceneStub) → ScriptLLMResponse` |

Point these at any LLM API. The test suite injects fakes, so `pytest` passes without a real key — the stubs only block the live pipeline.

### 5. Run the stack

```bash
# Terminal 1 — API server
uv run uvicorn server.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2 — Next.js dev server
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Tutorial

This walkthrough exercises all six architectural claims. Run it after wiring up your LLM client.

### Start a run

1. Open the Start Run page at `http://localhost:3000`. Fill in the spec:
   ```
   Learning objective: Add fractions with unlike denominators
   Worked example expression: 3/4 + 1/8
   Target duration: 5 minutes
   Audience: 6th grade
   ```
   Set run mode to **accept_edits**. Click Start Run.

2. The run page at `/runs/:id` polls every 2 seconds. Artifacts appear in the tree as stages complete — `content_tree`, then `script`, and so on.

3. **Interrupt A — review the script.** The review panel mounts when the graph pauses. You can:
   - **Approve as-is** — continues without changes
   - **Chat** — type "make the intro shorter"; the AI proposes an updated artifact; click Send then Approve
   - **Edit JSON directly** — modify the raw artifact in the textarea, then Submit

4. **Interrupt B — review the scene graph.** Each scene shows its assigned renderer. To override, chat: *"switch the recap scene to Manim"*. Confirm in the JSON pane, then Approve.

5. After Interrupt B, the verification gate runs (sympy checks the math), then scenes render in parallel. Each `scene_preview` and `scene_final` artifact appears with an inline video player.

6. The final MP4 is written to `artifacts/<hash>/output.mp4`. The `FinalManifest` artifact in the tree contains the path.

### Verifying the six claims

| # | Claim | How to verify |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | Content-addressed selective regeneration | Run the same spec twice — second run logs "cache hit" for every scene. Edit one scene's narration, re-run — only that scene re-renders. |
| C2 | Kill and resume | While paused at Interrupt A, click Simulate Crash. Restart uvicorn. Click Resume — the run continues from the interrupt, not the beginning. |
| C3 | Human interrupt via `Command(resume=…)` | Confirm both Approve and a raw JSON edit round-trip correctly through the graph. |
| C4 | Independent sympy verification | At Interrupt A, edit `worked_example.stated_answer` to `"1/2"` (wrong). Approve. The run halts at the verification gate — rendering never starts. |
| C5 | Renderer routing and override | Confirm `GET /runs/:id/artifacts` shows worked-example/guided-practice tagged `manim`, others `remotion`. Override a tag via chat at Interrupt B. |
| C6 | Selective hash invalidation | After a full run, start a new run, edit one scene's narration at Interrupt A. Only that scene's `scene_input_hash` changes — siblings reuse cached `SceneFinal` artifacts. |

---

## Creating a domain pack

A domain pack is a plain Python object satisfying the `DomainPack` protocol. No plugin registry, no dynamic loading — just an importable instance you pass to `build_graph()`.

### The four things to implement

| Attribute | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `spec_schema` | `type[BaseModel]` | Pydantic model that validates the incoming spec JSON |
| `structure(spec)` | `→ ContentTree` | Turns a validated spec into an ordered list of `SceneStub`s with render hints and content hints for the script LLM |
| `verification_gates(scene)` | `→ list[VerificationGate]` | Returns callables that check a `SceneGraphEntry` before rendering; return `[]` for scenes that don't need verification |
| `safety_profile` | `SafetyProfile` | `disallowed_topics` and `age_rating` — used to constrain LLM system prompts |

Gates always run regardless of run mode. A failed gate stops the run before rendering.

### Skeleton

Create a new package at `domains/my_domain/`:

```python
# domains/my_domain/src/my_domain/__init__.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from spectacle_core.domain_pack import (
    ContentTree, SceneStub, SafetyProfile,
    VerificationOutcome,
)
from spectacle_core.hashing import content_hash
from spectacle_core.models import SceneGraphEntry


class MySpec(BaseModel):
    topic: str
    target_duration_minutes: int
    audience: str


def structure(spec: MySpec) -> ContentTree:
    spec_hash = content_hash(spec.model_dump(mode="json"))
    scenes = [
        SceneStub(
            scene_id="intro_1",
            render_hint="layout",          # "layout" → Remotion, "equation_morph" → Manim
            content_hint=f"Introduce {spec.topic} for {spec.audience}",
            target_duration_s=20.0,
            verify=False,
        ),
        # add more stubs to fill spec.target_duration_minutes
    ]
    return ContentTree(spec_hash=spec_hash, scenes=scenes)


def verification_gates(scene: SceneGraphEntry) -> list:
    # Return [] for scenes that don't need checking.
    # For checkable content (math, code, citations), return callables:
    #   def my_gate(scene: SceneGraphEntry) -> VerificationOutcome: ...
    return []


class _MyPack:
    spec_schema = MySpec
    structure = staticmethod(structure)
    verification_gates = staticmethod(verification_gates)
    safety_profile = SafetyProfile(
        disallowed_topics=["violence", "adult content"],
        age_rating="general",
    )


my_pack = _MyPack()
```

### Wiring it into the app

Pass your pack instance to `build_graph()` in `apps/server/src/server/run_manager.py`:

```python
from my_domain import my_pack

graph = build_graph(
    domain_pack=my_pack,
    store=LocalFileArtifactStore(artifact_root),
    tts_provider=MacSayTTSProvider(),
    checkpointer=checkpointer,
    script_llm_fn=your_llm_fn,
)
```

### Custom verification gates

A gate is any callable matching `(scene: SceneGraphEntry) → VerificationOutcome`. The education pack uses sympy for math. Other ideas:

- A code sandbox that executes generated snippets
- A citation verifier that checks URLs are reachable
- An LLM judge that scores content against a rubric
- A static fact-checker for trivia/quiz content

### Core must stay domain-agnostic

`packages/core` must never import from your domain pack. If you find yourself wanting to add a domain-specific branch inside a core node, the right place for that logic is a verification gate or a new field on `SceneStub` / `SceneGraphEntry` — not a conditional in core.

## Renderer design

### K-8 visual design system

Both renderers share a common design language for K-8 educational content.

**Palette** — dark-navy background (`#0b1021`), matched exactly between Remotion and Manim.

**Scene-type badges** — every scene renders a colored badge indicating where the student is in the lesson:

| Scene type | Badge | Color |
|---|---|---|
| `intro` | Introduction | `#60a5fa` (blue) |
| `concept_explanation` | Key Concept | `#a78bfa` (purple) |
| `worked_example` | Worked Example | `#fb923c` (orange) |
| `guided_practice` | Try It! | `#facc15` (yellow) |
| `recap` | Recap | `#4ade80` (green) |

The badge color drives a thin top-edge accent stripe and (in Manim scenes) the progress-dot fill color for the current step.

### Remotion layout scenes

`LayoutScene.tsx` renders narration + bullet items as a full-screen typography card, using one of three layout variants chosen from the scene type so the same component doesn't feel repetitive across a lesson:

| Scene type | Layout | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `intro`, `recap` | **Cards** | punchy summary — bullets as a horizontal row of cards, active card scales up |
| `concept_explanation` | **Spotlight** | bullets on the left; a large icon panel on the right crossfades to the visual for whichever bullet is currently being narrated |
| `worked_example`, `guided_practice` | **Timeline** | sequential/step-like content — bullets laid out along a connecting line with icon nodes that light up in order |

Every bullet carries a `render_params.itemIcons[i]` entry — one of a fixed set of inline-SVG icons defined in `icons.tsx` (`lightbulb`, `target`, `book`, `chart_bar`, `chart_line`, `check`, `calculator`, `puzzle`, `star`, `arrow_right`, `compare`, `clock`). The script agent's LLM call picks the icon per bullet at the same time it writes the bullet text (see `_ICON_NAMES` / `item_icons` in `script_agent.py`); a bullet's icon is its visual element, so no separate image-generation call is needed. If `itemIcons` is missing or its length doesn't match `items` (e.g. an older cached artifact), the component falls back to a deterministic icon cycle rather than rendering a blank slot.

Bullets reveal at `render_params.itemStartTimesS[i]` — the second within the narration where that bullet's sentence begins speaking (computed in `render_scene.py` from word-count timing against the synthesized audio duration) — so on-screen reveals stay in sync with what's being said instead of an arbitrary even stagger. The active bullet (and, in the Spotlight/Timeline layouts, its icon) is highlighted for as long as its sentence is the one being narrated. A global fade-out occupies the last 18 frames of every scene so clips cut cleanly.

### Manim equation scenes

`MultiStepScene` in `manim_scene.py` renders step-by-step fraction solving. Each step shows a step label above the LaTeX equation; the last step uses the green accent color. Progress dots in the top-right track position.

`render_params.sceneType` is forwarded from the script agent to Manim so the correct badge color is applied without any domain knowledge inside core.

### FFmpeg timebase normalization

Remotion produces MP4s with `time_base=1/90000`. Manim produces MP4s with `time_base=1/15360` (Manim's internal clock). The FFmpeg concat demuxer silently drops all frames from clips whose timebase differs from the first clip — causing Manim scenes to disappear from the final video with no error.

Fix: `mux_audio_video()` in `render_scene.py` adds `-video_track_timescale 90000` when muxing each scene's audio onto the video. This rewrites the container timebase without re-encoding, making all clips compatible before they reach the concat step.

---

## Extension seams

Two seams exist for a future GCP deployment without rewriting any existing code.

**ArtifactStore → GCS.** `LocalFileArtifactStore` implements six methods (`put_json`, `get_json`, `exists`, `put_file`, `file_path`, `file_exists`). A `GCSArtifactStore` is a second implementation of the same protocol — swap it in at `build_graph(store=...)` and nothing else changes.

**render_scene → Cloud Tasks.** `render_scene.py` currently dispatches rendering in-process. Cloud Tasks dispatch can reuse the same `interrupt()` / `Command(resume=…)` primitive already used for human review — the resume signal comes from a Cloud Tasks callback instead of a human click. Graph topology stays identical.

GCP deployment (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, GCS, Cloud Tasks), concurrent multi-user runs, and CI/CD are not implemented in this repo.
